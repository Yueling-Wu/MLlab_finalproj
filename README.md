# MLlab Final Project
Predict Sales Performance of summer clothes 

## Dataset
The Sales of summer clothes in E-commerce Wish dataset comes from Kaggle, it contains features like price, product rating, color, size, shipping options, unit sold etc, for each product.

Original data: 1573 rows and 43 columns
24 numeric columns and 19 string-type columns 
Data size: 1.2MB

## Analytic Goal
Use two Machine Learning models to predict sales performance.
Try a traditional classification model and creatively transform a regression model for binary classification. Compare the model performance.

## Machine Learning Model from scikit-learn
1. regression model - BayesianRidge
2. classification model - Decision Tree
